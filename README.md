# Sneaker Collector
  - Welcome to Sneaker Collector, a tool used to organize your shoe collection. On Sneaker Collector, you are able to create an account and keep track of your entire sneaker portfolio. You are also able to compare you portfolio to other users using the leaderboard feature.

## Getting Started
  - You want to make sure you clone the repository by typing ```git clone git@github.com:rgonzalez12/sneaker-collector.git`` into your terminal.
  - After you have cloned the repo, make sure you are in the right directory, so type ```cd sneaker-collector``` and you will be in the home directory.
  - You do not have to install anymore gems, everything you need is already in the file. You will enter ```bundle install``` into the terminal, wait for everything to install, and then you can run the application.

## Running the test
